The inner eastern suburbs of Sydney  are swimming in good caffeine and food for that matter - any number of cuisines are available nearby as the area is scattered with amazing restaurants and cafes.  

The inner eastern suburbs is extremely central to what Sydney has to offer and has a great village feel to it.  I love living here and can't imagine living anywhere else and I hope for you to have the same experiences during your stay.

We became Airbnb.com hosts back in December 2010.   I was originally an architect, but worked in IT sales/marketing for the next 30+ years.  Semi-retired now,  I still manage consulting projects involving the Internet for small-medium businesses and some community based campaigns to promote better planning outcomes for the whole community, not just developers and their “top end of town” mates.

I call myself an Internet Architect on my business card these days.  Most of my current projects involve marketing using social media tools.

A born and bred Sydneysider, I lived in UK for 10 years till 1984.  I have done lots of travel in Europe, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, China, Vietnam, Japan, New Zealand, USA. 

Studio Yindi incorporates the things we look for when selecting boutique hotels, pensions, hostels and B&Bs for ourselves - space, privacy, wifi Internet access, reading light at the bedside, comfortable and practical for working while ""on the road"", a bit unusual, a little surprise, and value for money. 

My own preferences are for adventure and off the beaten track, rather than luxury, international 5 star. 

We love meeting travellers from all parts of the world, and helping them enjoy the experience of a first visit to Sydney.

We have lots of experience assisting overseas based friends and colleagues to see the best parts of Sydney, using public transport, and avoiding the expensive tourist services.

Messing about on boats is one of my passions. I have a 7.2 m (24') yacht moored nearby on the harbour and know a lot about the nice parts of our extensive waterways, including its part in Australian history.  I love sharing tips on how to see the best of the harbour, using inexpensive public ferries, plus strolls around Cremorne Point from Mosman Bay, or the 3 - 4 hour walk from the Spit to Manly, via Sydney Harbour National Park.

Welcome to Sydney and Kepos Terrace. 

I've lived and studied in Sydney all my life, and I love where I live. 
I'm an artist, so ask me a thousand questions about the Sydney art scene, but watch me blush if your query requires sports knowledge. 

I graduated with an honors degree with National Art School NSW, so there are a few of my paintings around the house, and I am currently working on my next piece.  

I do work full-time, and regularly I attend new shows and gallery openings after work,  and on the weekends I like to have no plans but to simply enjoy being around the house and sometimes having friends over. I am quite busy during the week,  but on the weekends I have more time to sit and talk with  you about my ideas and thoughts about places to go and things to do in Sydney, or even to plan to see events together.     

Regarding pets, I have a lovely cat named Roger, who is friendly and very well mannered. He will come for a pat if encouraged, or he will leave you alone,  (he gets a mention in every review).

I have done some traveling, and in 2009 I traveled through New York with airbnb. 

That's me in a nutshell! 

We look forward to meeting you.

I now do a bit of volunteer work and spend time connecting with friends old and new, and play boules and mahjong when I can.  I am also enjoying discovering walks in various parts of Sydney - I am amazed how I can be delighted by new discoveries in the city of my birth. All the better informed for guests from out of town. 
I have lived and travelled extensively - San Francisco, Tokyo, Saigon and outside of London when I was a child.  Love to travel and meet new people, particularly those from other places.  Have travelled in Asia, and a bit in Europe. Love Italy and la dolce vita.  Have seen quite a bit of the US (my dad took me to New York for my 14th birthday!!) and been on safari in Africa but not made it to other continents yet.  
Can't imagine life without friends, good spicy food and the prospect of another travel adventure.  Have backpacked, and travelled in style, kayaked down rivers and even hiked the Kokoda Track sharing a backpack with my boyfriend of the time.  I continue to travel now with perhaps the focus being on catching up with beloved friends all over the world from the days of living and working overseas.
Now prefer softer options along with a good bottle of wine, delicious food of the region wherever, classical music or some great rock.
Age is a state of mind rather than the years lived, and it is good to be able to look backwards and forwards.
